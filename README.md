# 🍽️ Sasi's Recipes - HTML & CSS Food Recipe Website

Welcome to **Sasi's Recipes**, a simple and clean food recipe website built using **HTML and CSS**. This is my **first frontend project**, where I practiced structuring web content and styling it to look visually appealing and user-friendly.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – For semantic structure and layout
* **CSS3** – For styling, layout, and hover effects
* **Flexbox** – For responsive design
* **Google Fonts (optional)** – You can add one for better typography
* **Box Shadows, Gradients, and Hover Effects** – For modern UI touches
